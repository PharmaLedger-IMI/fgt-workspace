     17	Password verification bugs	(The quality of the password on the login should not be checked/The regular expresion for special charcaters is not complet)
     18	Error handling when a batch with the same number (and the same GTIN) is created twice:	errors are displayed now
     19	Scanning should display information from the 2dMatrix

 New features:
      3	Persistent Vault (same as bugs 5,12)
      6	Enable smart contract checks
      7	Adding MAH input in the login 
 Observations
     - we have improved error messages and error handling in DSU Fabric
     - some anticounterfeit checks in place but full implementation in the next interation
 Known issues:
     -  sharing of the wallets between users happens only by sharing the login credentials. Sharing only of the data is planed for the next iteration
     
 Instalation observations:
   epi domain should be configured in server and connected with the blockchain adapter
   the vault and the default domains should remain as FS
