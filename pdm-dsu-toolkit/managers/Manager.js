 * Manager Classes in this context should do the bridge between the controllers

 *
 * All Manager Classes should be singletons.
 *
 * This complete separation of concerns is very beneficial for 2 reasons:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Allows for testing since there's no browser dependent code (i think) since the DSUStorage can be 'mocked'</li>
 *     <li>Allows for different controllers access different business logic when necessary (while benefiting from the singleton behaviour)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param {Archive|Database} storage the DSU where the storage should happen or more commonly the Database Object
 * @param {BaseManager} baseManager the base manager to have access to the identity api
 * @module managers
