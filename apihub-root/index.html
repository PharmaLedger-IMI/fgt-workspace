        <p>Demonstration of order and shipment management, mapping traceability of every lot (batch) using blockchain - through
            <a href="http://opendsu.com" target="_blank">OpenDSU</a> technology.</p>

        <p>The web applications above (which should be easily compiled to native mobile Android/iOS applications) are just for
            demonstration purposes, and will not exist in the future (so, no real effort was done on usability with large data
            volumes). The <span style="font-weight: bold;">long-term vision</span> is that every company (MAH, Wholesaler,
            Pharmacy) already has their own
            ERPs, and integration with the blockchain should be provided by web service gateways that translate the existing
            order/shipment management ERP operations on to blockchain read/write operations (so that each company operates as
            usual as they already do today).</p>

        <p>Minor bug fixes;</p>

        <h3>Test Script</h3>
        <h5>Browser</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Open an MAH Wallet, and log in. (This ensures that there is an active listener for messages sent to the MAH). Leave that tab open and proceed with the script.</li>
            <li>Open an Wholesale Wallet, and log in ; Go to the "Orders Received" and there are some pre-created orders (from Pharmacies) available. ; For any of those orders, click the "clockwork wheel" ; A "CREATE SHIPMENT" screen appears. Click on the "ORDER MISSING", and it jumps to a "CREATE ORDER" screen ; On the "CREATE ORDER" screen, select the pre-existing MAHID, and then press "ISSUED ORDER +", and "CONFIRM".</li>
            <li>Go the MAH Wallet tab previously opened; Go to the "Orders", and the order just created from the Wholesaler should be visible. ; For that specific order, click the "Cogwheel" ; A "CREATE SHIPMENT" screen appears ; Click on "CONFIRM ALL AVAILABLE", and then click on the "CREATE +", and "CONFIRM".</li>
            <li>Still in the MAH Wallet, go to 'Shipment Lines'. The ShipmentLines referring the the newly created shipments should be listed;</li>
            <li>Return to Wholesale Wallet click "Shipments" => "Incoming Shipments"; you should find the recently created incoming shipment displayed in the list; Click "Orders" => "Issued Orders" you should see a 'train' button in the recently created Order. The order is now linked to the shipment. Click the "Eye" button; Its status should have changed to 'ACKNOWLEDGED';</li>
            <li>Return to the MAH Wallet, go to 'Shipments' and click on the "Cogwheel" for the recently created shipment; Click "MARK AS 'FOR PICKUP'" and confirm. This will update the shipment status</li>
            <li>Go back to the Wholesaler Wallet, click "Orders" => "Issued Orders" and the "Eye" button for the created Order; The status of the order should have changed to "FOR PICKUP";</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>v0.3.3 Release notes 2021-06-29</h2>

        <p>Adds the possibility to add requesters/senders to the directory (allowing to choose newly created wallets as targets for orders/shipments);</p>
        <p>The limitation of not being able to create a shipment without an order, exists solely because without an order and without eGovernance,
            we have no way of knowing the destination address, which is mandatory for a shipment in the existing Data Model
            (and required for all user stories that include 'time until delivery' estimation). This limitation would not exist in a real product because all the information would be provided by the participants ERP systems.</p>

        <h2>v0.3.1 Release notes 2021-06-28</h2>

        <p>Technological architecture refactoring (using ionic components) complete;</p>

        <p>Creation and transmission of orders complete;</p>
        <p>Creation and transmission of shipments complete;</p>
        <p>Creation and transmission of orderLines complete - deprecated - will be removed for the next release;</p>
        <p>Creation and transmission of shipmentLines complete;</p>
        <p>Auto Instantiation of Participant Wallets with dummy data complete (we await proper 'real' data to start recreating a proper business environment);</p>

        <h3>Upcoming developments for the next release:</h3>
        <p>Order And Shipment status update;</p>
        <p>Final product state implementation (ADMINISTERED);</p>
        <p>Traceability on the batch level after product is in final state;</p>
        <p>Implicit stock evaluation for all chain of custody participants by the MAH for their products;</p>

                    <li>Some buttons are enabled when they shouldn't be and clicking them (without the necessary preconditions) will throw an error. eg: Create a shipment with products not confirmed or that you have no stock for;</li>
                    <li>Some screens still allows for 'illegal actions': eg: a 'Manage issued shipment' screen will still allow adding products, which it shouldn't;</li>
